		<h2>About this Page</h2>

		<p> This is just a little page I made to practice what I've learned using html and css. Perhaps some day I might actually convert it into something more useful, such as an online resume or an actual blog. I'm not intending to creat anything amazing or particularly attractive. It sure as hell doesn't need to be perfect. Just a platform to help further understand the skills that I'm devoloping. But as to that goal, I am going to include a few tidbits about myself that just to keep things interesting.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<img src="img/travis.jpg">

		<p>It's always hard to know what to write about oneself. Each individual has so many different apsects that trying to smash them all into a few little paragraphs or even an entire webpage is not doing justice to the diversity found even at the individual level. I thrive on excitement, hence the interest in <a href="hobbies.html">skydiving</a>. However, I also find enjoyment in sitting queitly and observing the world around me. I like to be social, to get silly with friends and make a racous (check out the <a href="#">pirate battle</a> pics). Yet a just as much enjoy being a homebody, reading a good book or playing on the computer.</p>
		<p>I guess for me the key is balance. The ability to truly experience life by involving yourself in all of it's diversity. To focus just on one area is to loose perspective. You box yourself in and narrow your own definition. And that's just no fun.</p>
