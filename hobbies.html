		<p>On first glance, a person veiwing my hobbies my think that I have ADD. And perhaps I do a little. But really, it goes back to what I said previously. I enjoy life, in all of it's aspects. That's why I'm happy flying above the earth <a href="#skydiving">skydiving</a>, finding peace on a rock while <a href="#rock_climbing">rock climbing</a>, emmersing myself in the natural beauty of nature while <a href="#backpacking">backpacking</a>, exploring the natural wonders of our world while <a href="#travel">traveling</a> or simply geeking out with friends and <a href="#gaming">gaming</a>.

	</div>

	<div class="grid_8">
		<p>Now I know what most people think. "Damn adrenaline junkies always gotta be doin' somethin' dangerous." Well, let me dispell that some. First, it's not just about the adrenaline. Yes, that's part of it but once you get used to skydiving, it doesn't really happen as much. At that point it's simply about the feeling of flying. Skydiving is human body flight. Contrary to popular belief, you don't just fall while skydiving. If you fall at 120mp, that means you have 120mp of relative wind hitting you. That's a lot of wind resistance and a lot of force to work with. Depending on body position, you have an unlimited range of motion.<br>
		Secondly, skydiving really isn't that dangerous. Yes people die every year, around 20 I beleive. For more info you can go <a href="http://dropzone.com">here</a>. But all things considered that's relatively few compared to what most people do on a daily basis. And most casualties are form operator error, people being stupid or complacent. The equipment, techniques and all around sport is safe. That being said though, you shouldn't take it lightly. If you do skydive, keep in mind that you are essentially playing chicken with the earth. And the earth will <strong>always</strong> win.</p>

		<p>Rock climbing is another sport that many people seem to think you need to be an adrenalin junky to partake in. Again, while the adrenalin is part of it, it's certainly not all, or even most. For me, rock climbing is about the stillness of mind that extreme focus can create. In order to get that difficult move, you have to be focused. You have to be present. You can't stay angry over the argument you had yesterday, or worry about the interview you have in a couple of days. You have to clear your mind of all distractions, block it all out. Up there, it's just you and the rock. One move to the next. Climbing is about peace. You take on the aspects of the element your dealing with. Still, calm, and unmoving.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="grid_8">
		<p>It's so easy for us to get stuck within our own lives. We get so wrapped up in our own worries, problems and joys that we forget that there's a much larger world out there full of wonders, hardships, and lessons. We, as people, far too easily allow ourselves to loose that perspective.<br>
		The best way to get that perspective back? Simply break out of your own life and experience that of others for a while. <strong>Travel</strong>. By this, I mean a very specific kind of travel. When some people think of traveling, they think about fancy hotels, beach resorts, cruises, that sort of thing. While there's nothing wrong with that sort of traveling, if that's all you do, you're missing out on so much. When I say travel, what I really mean is go to another country, for at least two weeks, and try to get involved with the local population. Don't speak the language? Oh well, make due. Actually, english is so prolific now days you'll probably have locals coming up to you wanting to use you as practice anyways, so don't worry. But get involved. Get a taste of what their lives are like. There's nothing more humbling and eye opening as seeing Cambodian children in rags, some missing limbs from land mines, one minute being used by their parents as beggars to make money, and the next minute running around and playing with as big a carefree smile as you'll see in any of the first world nations. Break out of your own life and travel.</p>
